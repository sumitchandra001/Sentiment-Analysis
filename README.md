💬 Sentiment Analysis System
This project is a machine learning-based application designed to analyze the sentiment of textual data. It classifies text as positive, negative, or neutral using pre-trained models and natural language processing techniques. Ideal for social media analysis, customer feedback evaluation, and opinion mining.

📌 Project Features
Upload or enter text for sentiment analysis

Text preprocessing including tokenization and stopword removal

Use of ML models like Naive Bayes or Transformer-based classifiers

Display classification results with confidence scores

Clean user interface for easy input and results view

🛠️ Technologies Used
Language: Python

Frontend: Tkinter / Streamlit (depending on interface)

ML Libraries: Scikit-learn, NLTK, Transformers (HuggingFace)

Data Processing: Pandas, NumPy

Visualization: Matplotlib / Seaborn (if applicable)

⚙️ Installation & Setup
1. Clone the Repository
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/sentiment-analysis-system.git
cd sentiment-analysis-system
2. Install Dependencies
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install numpy pandas nltk scikit-learn transformers
3. Run the Application
bash
Copy
Edit
python app.py
or for Streamlit version:

bash
Copy
Edit
streamlit run app.py
🧪 How It Works
User inputs or uploads text data.

System preprocesses the data (cleaning, tokenization, etc.).

Sentiment classification is performed using trained models.

Output sentiment (positive/negative/neutral) and confidence score is displayed.
